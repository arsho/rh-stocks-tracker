RH Stocks Tracker Chrome Extension

Effective Date: February 16, 2026

RH Stocks Tracker is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to provide users with a clear summary of their stock portfolio totals directly on the Robinhood Investing page. The extension calculates and displays Profit, Loss, Net return, Total Equity, and total number of holdings based on visible on-screen data. It also allows users to manually save snapshots locally and visualize net return trends over time. All processing occurs entirely within the user’s browser. The extension does not collect personal information, transmit data externally, inject advertisements, or perform background tracking. Its sole function is local portfolio summarization and optional historical tracking for the user’s convenience.
